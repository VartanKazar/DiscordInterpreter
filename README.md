## Introduction

Accessibility is an important part of giving people from all walks of life equal access and and equal opportunities. Especially on the internet, including Discord, more people can participate more actively in communities and activities if they have the right tools available to them.

Discord Interpreter can provide a bridge to helping those which want to actively participate in these communities and activities.

### Compatability
Discord Interpreter can run on any device and server which supports installation of discord bots 

### Java Coding Standards
Our team made an effort to follow the [Java coding standards](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconvtoc-136057.html "Java Coding Standards") and adhere to the foundational principles of coding.

## Technologies

This project uses Java SDK v13.0.2

#### JDA (Java Discord API)
* JDA strives to provide a clean and full wrapping of the Discord REST api and its Websocket-Events for Java. This library is a helpful tool that provides the functionality to create a discord bot in java.
#### CMUSphinx
* Provides state of art speech recognition algorithms for efficient speech recognition. CMUSphinx tools are designed specifically for low-resource platforms and supports several languages such as US English, UK English, French, Mandarin, German, Dutch, Russian and ability to build a models for others. It also has a wide range of tools for many speech-recognition related purposes (keyword spotting, alignment, pronuncation evaluation).
#### Google Cloud's speech API
* Google Speech-to-Text lets developers convert audio to text by applying neural network models in an easy-to-use API. The API recognizes 120 languages to support a global user base. You can enable voice command-and-control, transcribe audio from call centers, and more. It can also process real-time streaming or prerecorded audio with machine learning technology.
##### Languages
* Discord Interpreter is based in Java thanks to JDA which provides a wrapping of the Discord API for Java code.
